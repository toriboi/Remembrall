Remembrall

Okay! This name is inspired from the movie Harry Potter...if you know you know. It's an SPA, built with Javascript. 
It randomly(always) brings out 6 colors in sets of two(2) boxes out of 12, so you get a few secs glance at it, and have to match it as it is.
This process  continues, for as long as you'd like. Contributions would be appreciated.
